# maas_volume_group (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage MAAS Volume Groups, and construct them from partion-less block devices.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "maas_block_device" "vdb1" {
  machine        = maas_machine.virsh_vm2.id
  name           = "vdb1"
  id_path        = "/dev/vdb1"
  size_gigabytes = 27
  tags = [
    "ssd",
  ]
}

resource "maas_block_device" "vdb2" {
  machine        = maas_machine.virsh_vm2.id
  name           = "vdb2"
  id_path        = "/dev/vdb2"
  size_gigabytes = 35
  tags = [
    "ssd",
  ]

  partitions {
    size_gigabytes = 30
  }
}

resource "maas_volume_group" "vg1" {
  name          = "volume group 1"
  machine       = maas_machine.virsh_vm2.id
  block_devices = [maas_block_device.vdb1.id]
  partitions    = [maas_block_device.vdb2.partitions.0.id]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `machine` (String) The machine identifier (system ID, hostname, or FQDN) that owns the volume group.
- `name` (String) The name for this volume group

### Optional

- `block_devices` (Set of String) The list of block device ids to be included in this volume group.
*Note*: For the boot disk, a partition should be supplied instead, as MAAS would otherwise automatically create one.
- `partitions` (Set of String) The list of partition ids to be included in this volume group.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `size_gigabytes` (Number) The volume group size (GiB).
- `uuid` (String) Volume group UUID.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Volume groups can be imported with the machine identifier (system ID, hostname, or FQDN) and the volume group identifier (ID or name). e.g.
$ terraform import maas_volume_group.vg1 machine-06/vg1
```
