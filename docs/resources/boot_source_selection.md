# maas_boot_source_selection (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage a MAAS boot source selection.

*Note*: MAAS automatically creates a default commissioning boot source selection for the Ubuntu LTS release that accompanies the current MAAS version (e.g., Noble for MAAS 3.6). The commissioning distro series can be changed by administrators, but whatever boot source selection points to the current commissioning distro series at any point in time cannot be deleted. When managing boot source selections through Terraform:

- **Create**: If creating a selection for Ubuntu with the current commissioning distro series, Terraform will adopt and update the existing selection instead of creating a new one
- **Delete**: If deleting a selection that matches Ubuntu with the current commissioning distro series at deletion time, Terraform will remove the resource from state without deleting it from MAAS (no-op operation)

This behavior ensures MAAS functionality is not disrupted while allowing Terraform to manage boot source selection configurations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "maas_boot_source" "test_boot_source" {
  url = "http://images.maas.io/ephemeral-v3/candidate/"
}

resource "maas_boot_source_selection" "amd64" {
  boot_source = maas_boot_source.test_boot_source.id

  os      = "ubuntu"
  release = "jammy"
  arches  = ["amd64"]
}

# Only Hardware Enablement kernel (HWE) image
resource "maas_boot_source_selection" "amd64_hwe" {
  boot_source = maas_boot_source.test_boot_source.id

  os        = "ubuntu"
  release   = "jammy"
  arches    = ["amd64"]
  subarches = ["hwe-22.04"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `arches` (Set of String) The architecture list for this selection. Valid architectures are: `["amd64", "arm64", "armhf", "i386", "ppc64el", "s390x"]`
- `boot_source` (Number) The boot source database ID this selection is associated with.
- `os` (String) The operating system for this selection.
- `release` (String) The specific release of the operating system for this selection.

### Optional

- `labels` (Set of String) The label list for this selection. Default is: `["*"]`
- `subarches` (Set of String) The list of subarches for this selection. Default is: `["*"]`
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# A boot resource selection can be imported using the boot source ID and the boot source selection ID. e.g.
$ terraform import maas_boot_source.example boot_source:id
```
