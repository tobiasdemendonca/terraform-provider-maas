# maas_vm_host (Resource)

Provides a resource to manage MAAS VM hosts.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "maas_vm_host" "kvm_virsh" {
  type          = "virsh"
  power_address = "qemu+ssh://ubuntu@10.113.1.24/system"
  tags = [
    "pod-console-logging",
    "virtual",
    "kvm",
  ]
}

# A LXD VM host. A certificate will be generated if not provided
resource "maas_vm_host" "lxd_no_certificate" {
  type          = "lxd"
  power_address = "10.10.0.1"
  project       = "test-project"
  password      = "my-lxd-trust-password"
}

# New, untrusted certificates can be trusted by specifying the LXD trust password or token
resource "maas_vm_host" "lxd_new_certificate" {
  type          = "lxd"
  power_address = "10.10.0.1"
  project       = "test-project"
  password      = "my-lxd-trust-password"
  certificate   = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n certificate-goes-here =\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
  key           = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n key-goes-here ==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
}

# If the certificate is already trusted by your LXD cluster, the trust password can be omitted
resource "maas_vm_host" "lxd_pre_trusted_certificate" {
  type          = "lxd"
  power_address = "10.10.0.1"
  project       = "test-project"
  certificate   = "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n certificate-goes-here =\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
  key           = "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n key-goes-here ==\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `type` (String) The VM host type. Supported values are: `lxd`, `virsh`.

### Optional

- `certificate` (String, Sensitive) Certificate to use for power control of a LXD VM host. It can't be set if `machine`, `power_user` or `power_pass` parameters are used.
- `cpu_over_commit_ratio` (Number) The new VM host CPU overcommit ratio. This is computed if it's not set.
- `default_macvlan_mode` (String) The new VM host default macvlan mode. Supported values are: `bridge`, `passthru`, `private`, `vepa`. This is computed if it's not set.
- `deploy_params` (Block List, Max: 1) Nested argument with the config used to deploy the machine specified using `machine`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--deploy_params))
- `key` (String, Sensitive) Certificate key to use for power control of a LXD VM host. It can't be set if `machine`, `power_user`, or `power_pass` parameters are used.
- `machine` (String) The identifier (hostname, FQDN or system ID) of a registered ready MAAS machine. This is going to be deployed and registered as a new VM host. This argument conflicts with: `power_address`, `power_user`, `power_pass`, `certificate`, `key` and `password`.
- `memory_over_commit_ratio` (Number) The new VM host RAM memory overcommit ratio. This is computed if it's not set.
- `name` (String) The new VM host name. This is computed if it's not set.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) LXD trust password to use for power control of a LXD VM Host. If parameters `certificate` and `key` are used, the trust password will be used to trust the certificate-key pair. If no `certificate` and `key` are specified, MAAS will generate a trusted certificate and key for the VM host. It can't be set if `machine`, `power_user`, or `power_pass` parameters are used.
- `pool` (String) The new VM host pool name. This is computed if it's not set.
- `power_address` (String) Address that gives MAAS access to the VM host power control. For example: `qemu+ssh://172.16.99.2/system`. The address given here must reachable by the MAAS server. It can't be set if `machine` argument is used.
- `power_pass` (String, Sensitive) User password to use for power control of a Virsh VM host. Cannot be set if `machine`, `certificate`, `key` or `password` parameters are used.
- `power_user` (String) User name to use for power control of a Virsh VM host. Cannot be set if `machine`, `certificate`, `key` or `password` parameters are used.
- `project` (String) LXD project to be used by VM host to deploy machines to. Cannot be set if `machine`, `power_user` or `power_pass` parameters are used.
- `tags` (Set of String) A set of tag names to assign to the new VM host. This is computed if it's not set.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `zone` (String) The new VM host zone name. This is computed if it's not set.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `resources_cores_total` (Number) The VM host total number of CPU cores.
- `resources_local_storage_total` (Number) The VM host total local storage (in bytes).
- `resources_memory_total` (Number) The VM host total RAM memory (in MB).

<a id="nestedblock--deploy_params"></a>
### Nested Schema for `deploy_params`

Optional:

- `distro_series` (String) The distro series used to deploy the specifed MAAS machine. If it's not given, the MAAS server default value is used.
- `enable_hw_sync` (Boolean) Periodically sync hardware
- `hwe_kernel` (String) Hardware enablement kernel to use with the image. Only used when deploying Ubuntu.
- `user_data` (String) Cloud-init user data script that gets run on the machine once it has deployed. A good practice is to set this with `file("/tmp/user-data.txt")`, where `/tmp/user-data.txt` is a cloud-init script.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String)
- `delete` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# VM hosts can be imported using the ID or the name. e.g.
$ terraform import maas_vm_host.kvm vm-host-01
```
